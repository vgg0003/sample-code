The database connected should be a vaariant of mySQL.

The command to run:
java -classpath ".:mysql-connector-java-8.0.16.jar" DatabaseGui

The mysql-connector-java-8.0.16.jar file must be in the same directory.

The program will first prompt on the commandline for the database information, then the user can use solely the GUI.
On the left is a list of the tables, which will display the table conents when double-clicked or by pressing enter when the table is highlighted.
On the right is an editable text box which will send SQL commands to the database after clicking the submit button and display the results.
On the bottom is a non-editable text box which shows the results of the SQL queries.

Testing database: MariaDB ver 15.1 Distrib 10.6.21-MariaDB, for debian-linux-gnu (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
Java version : openjdk 11.0.26
